🧠 Lucid Core — Backend Documentation
🚀 Overview

Lucid is a next-generation Conversation Version Control System (CVCS) — a new approach to how humans and AI collaborate, debug, and evolve reasoning.

Just as Git revolutionized software versioning, Lucid aims to revolutionize AI reasoning versioning.

It transforms AI chats into structured, branching reasoning graphs, enabling reproducible, auditable, and collaborative thought processes between humans and AI.

💡 Core Vision

Traditional AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) operate on linear conversations.
Once the context derails or the user encounters confusion, the entire workflow loses continuity.
Lucid solves this by treating conversations as version-controlled reasoning workflows.

🧩 Core Concepts
Concept	Description
Project	A logical workspace for related reasoning sessions. Each project acts as a container that stores all conversations, branches, and outputs related to a specific user goal.
Branch	A reasoning thread. When a user encounters confusion, they can create a new branch (like “debug branch”) to explore alternate reasoning paths — without breaking the main conversation flow.
Node	A single reasoning step: a user’s prompt and the AI’s response. Every node represents one atomic thought or operation in the workflow.
Artifact	Any file, diagram, or code generated during reasoning — stored and referenced against its originating node.
🧠 Problem Statement

Modern AI models are powerful but non-reproducible.

When conversations become complex, users face these issues:

They lose track of what worked and what didn’t.

They can’t branch off safely to test alternate reasoning paths.

Debugging AI workflows becomes inconsistent.

There’s no mechanism to “merge” insights from separate reasoning paths.

Lucid introduces a systematic reasoning layer — where AI reasoning gains traceability, reproducibility, and collaborative debugging.

🔍 The Lucid Solution

Lucid implements conversation version control, mirroring how developers use Git:

Action	Description
Create Project	Start a new reasoning workspace.
Create Branch	Fork from a reasoning step to explore alternate solutions.
Spawn Node	Each prompt and response is tracked as a versioned step.
Merge Branches	Successful experiments can be merged back to the main reasoning flow.
Track Artifacts	Every file, output, or report is linked to its reasoning node.

This makes AI interactions traceable, branchable, and mergeable — turning conversational reasoning into a structured knowledge system.

⚙️ Backend Architecture

Lucid’s backend forms the reasoning core, handling all data persistence, AI processing, and workflow state management.

Layer	Description
API Layer	FastAPI provides modular REST endpoints for managing projects, branches, nodes, and artifacts.
Database Layer	PostgreSQL stores structured data (relationships between projects, branches, and reasoning steps).
AI Reasoning Engine	Connects to Gemini 2.5 Pro for text generation and reasoning steps, easily swappable with OpenAI models.
Queue System	Redis + RQ manage asynchronous reasoning tasks and background workflows.
Storage Layer	MinIO acts as an S3-compatible storage for all generated artifacts and reports.
🧩 Logical Flow

A user starts a Project (workspace).

Within the project, they begin a Branch (a reasoning session).

Each interaction with the AI becomes a Node (prompt → response).

If the user encounters confusion or an error, they spawn a new Branch from that Node to explore alternatives.

Once satisfied, they can merge the branch back into the main reasoning flow.

Every step is stored, versioned, and retrievable — ensuring explainability and reproducibility.

🧱 System Design Summary
Component	Responsibility
FastAPI Server	Central control layer for routing all logic and data interactions.
Gemini/OpenAI Engine	Generates reasoning steps and explanations.
Redis Queue Worker	Handles asynchronous AI task execution.
PostgreSQL	Maintains structured reasoning data.
MinIO	Stores artifacts, diagrams, code, and outputs.

This modular architecture allows horizontal scaling — different reasoning tasks can execute independently via the queue system, while persistent logic is stored centrally.

🎯 Project Objective

Lucid’s backend is designed to provide:

A reproducible reasoning environment

Branch-based conversation management

Audit trails for AI-generated decisions

Continuous learning through branch merges

In essence, it turns reasoning into a trackable workflow, making AI debugging and collaboration intuitive and transparent.

🔮 Future Vision
Phase	Feature	Description
Phase 6	Branch Context Memory	Each branch will maintain its own conversation memory for contextual AI responses.
Phase 7	Merge & Diff System	Compare reasoning paths and merge improved logic into main flow.
Phase 8	Visualization Layer	Frontend integration for visualizing nodes, branches, and reasoning trees.
Phase 9	Adaptive Reasoning	Train Lucid to auto-learn from merges — creating a self-improving AI reasoning framework.
🧭 Lucid’s Broader Goal

Lucid is not just an AI chat system —
It’s a reasoning infrastructure layer for the next wave of AI applications.

It aims to power:

AI copilots that learn from user debugging

Collaborative reasoning systems for research and engineering

Explainable AI decision chains for enterprise and compliance use cases

In short, Lucid is the Git for AI thinking —
designed to make reasoning as structured and collaborative as coding.

🧩 Summary

Lucid Backend = The foundation of a reasoning-driven AI operating system

Built for transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration

Current milestone: Phase 5 (fully functional backend, CRUD, AI integration)

Next milestone: Phase 6 (context memory & adaptive branches)
